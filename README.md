# Assignment: Data Table



## Objective:



Develop a Data Table that displays data fetched from a Mock API. The table should incorporate Search, Sort, and Pagination functionalities. It is crucial to implement the solution using Typescript and ensure strong typing throughout the implementation. Also, I would like to point out that a pixel-perfect alignment of your implementation is essential.

## Core Requirements:



### 1. Fetch Data from Mock server API:



- Can be done with any packages and solutions you want, but preference is React-Query

- Define Response Type



### 2. Use Tanstack-Table to present Data



### 3. Pixel Perfect:



- coding table to match the Figma, pixel by pixel via the Tailwind package.



### 4. Search, Pagination, and Sort:



- Mock API does not support search, pagination, and sorting. use Tanstack-Table and your local state to implement those features.

## Bonus Points:



### 1. Use Generic Type for developing reusable Components and Functions



### 2. Folder Structure



### 3. Use Debounce search input



### 4. Unit Test
